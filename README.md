**The purpose of the repository.**



A GitHub repository(or "repo") serves as the cornerstone of a project, acting as a dynamic archive that houses files, chronicles revisions and fosters synergy among teams via Git's robust version control machinery.













**What the Python script does?**



A Python script featuring ' print("Hello world!") ' is a straightforward program that outputs the text "Hello world!" on screen when executed.

&nbsp;   

   **Here's the breakdown:**



* print() function:

&nbsp;     A built in Python function used to display a message to standard output on the screen.

&nbsp;

* "Hello world!":

&nbsp;     The string (text enclosed in quotation marks) that serves as the input argument to the 'ptint()' function.



* Execution:

      When you run the script, the Python interpreter reads this line, execute the 'print()' function, and display "Hello world!"

      as output.
